# LAB_6.3.1_spatialdata
In this lab we visualize the reclcying rates for each London burough from 2003 to 2021.
When considering the total time range, we can find the highest reclying rates in South-East (Bromley and Bexley) and North-West (Harrow and Hillingdon) London and the lowest rates in the centre (Westmister and Newham). 
When comparing the first and the last year observed, we can notice that the rates have increased in general accross all the buroughs, but South London is the area which increased the most.
